Apache Benchmark Docker image

## HTTP GET request

To send an HTTP GET request you can use:

	$ docker run --rm jordi/ab -v 2 https://www.docker.com/

## Pull

	$ docker pull jordi/ab

## Build

`git clone` this project, cd into it, and:

	$ docker build -t ab .
	
## HTTP POST request

Sending a POST request is slightly more convoluted. As `ab` requires the POST body to be in a file, you should pass the file from the host (well, the Docker client) to the container. There are several ways to do that, but perhaps the easiest is to share the current directory:

```
	$ docker run --rm --read-only -v `pwd`:`pwd` -w `pwd` jordi/ab -T application/json -p post.json -v 2 https://<server>/<api-func>
```

you must have the `post.json` file readable in your host current directory prior to execute `docker run ...`

# Notes

## Testing on localhost

If you try to test a server on your localhost, you cannot point to it using `http://localhost:8080/` as this is the address of the `jordi/ab` container itself. To test a service in your local machine or in a container in your local machine, use either the _hostname_ of your workstation (that will point to your Ethernet/WiFi IP address) or the Docker bridge address, that usually is `172.17.0.1`. For example, to launch an HTTP service in docker and benchmark it:

```
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 jordi/server:http
docker run --rm jordi/ab -k -c 100 -n 100000 http://172.17.0.1:8080/ 
```

You can check your actual Docker bridge address using either `ifconfig docker0` or `docker network inspect bridge`.

## _ab: invalid URL_

If you get this error, probably you forgot to end your URL with a slash (`/`). `ab` is picky about that:

- Wrong: `docker run --rm jordi/ab https://www.docker.com`
- Right: `docker run --rm jordi/ab https://www.docker.com/`
